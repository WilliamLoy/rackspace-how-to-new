This article describes how to change the password that is used to access a Rackspace Email mailbox. Users can change their own password through Webmail, and administrators can change the password for a user through the Cloud Office Control Panel.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User or administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 5 minutes
- **Tools required:**  Users need their current password; administrators need Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).

### Change your password through webmail

1. Log in to your mailbox at [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php).

   **Note:** Your password might already be entered when you log in to apps.rackspace.com. However, you must be able to manually enter the password in the following steps. If you do not know the password see [Rackspace Email password recovery FAQ](/how-to/rackspace-email-password-recovery-faq/) before proceeding.

2. Click your username in the upper-right corner and then select **Settings**.

4. Enter the following information:

    - **Current Password:** Enter the password that you just used to log in to the mailbox.
    - **New Password:** Enter the new password for the mailbox.
    - **Confirm Password:** Enter the new password again.

    **Note:** We recommend that you create a password that you have never used before and that remains unique from all your other passwords. Also, longer passwords provide better security for your account.

5. Click **Save**.

   **Note:** You must update your password on any device that you use to check mail for this mailbox.

### Change a password through Cloud Office Control Panel

**Note:** Only administrators have access to the Cloud Office Control Panel.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).
2. In the **Rackspace Email** section, click **Mailboxes**.
3. In the mailbox list, click the mailbox name for which you want to change the password.

   - **Confirm:** Enter the new password again.

   **Note:** We recommend that you create a password that you have never used before and that remains unique from all your other passwords. Also, longer passwords provide better security for your account.

5. Click **Submit**.
