Following are some frequently asked questions and answers about this
feature.

2. In the top-right corner, click the account's username and then select **Update Phone**.
3. Enter your phone number, and click **Save**.

After your phone number has been updated, you will receive a six digit verification code that confirms your number.

### How do I change my Rackspace Email password if I forgot it?

**Warning:** After you have changed your password, update the password on any device used to check this mailbox.

### Why is Webmail asking for my mobile phone number?

Webmail prompts you periodically to provide an up-to-date mobile phone
number. Providing an up-to-date mobile phone number gives you access to
the password recovery feature.

### How will my mobile phone number be used?

Your number is used only for account security purposes such as password
recovery. It will never be sold
to advertisers or other third parties. We might disclose your phone
number if it is reasonably necessary to comply with the law.
